# üõí Amazon Product Review Analysis

## üìå Introduction
This project explores and analyzes Amazon product reviews to uncover insights about customer behavior, product performance, and pricing strategies. 
Using Excel and data visualization techniques, it answers key business questions that can inform better product decisions and improve customer engagement.

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Amazon‚Äôs vast product listings and inconsistent review data make it difficult to:
- Identify top-performing products
- Understand customer satisfaction
- Evaluate pricing effectiveness

This limits informed decision-making for both buyers and sellers.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives 
- Identify top-rated and most-reviewed products  
- Understand the relationship between ratings and discount levels  
- Track customer feedback trends across categories
- Analyze the distribution of product prices 
- Build a clean, interactive Excel dashboard  

---

## üìä Data Source & Description
The dataset was scraped from Amazon product pages and contains:
- **Product Details**: name, category, price, discount, and ratings  
- **Customer Engagement**: user reviews, titles, and content  

Each row represents a unique product, with reviewer data stored as comma-separated values.

---

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Excel**: Data cleaning, calculated columns, Pivot Tables  
- **Charts**: Data visualization for rating, discount, and pricing patterns

--- 

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation
Here‚Äôs the step-by-step cleaning process:

- **Backup Original Data**: Created a copy of the original dataset for reference.
- **Removed Duplicates**: Dropped rows with duplicate `Product_ID`s.
- **Handled Missing Values**: Filled two missing `Rating_Count` entries using the column average.
- **Formatted Headers**: Capitalized headers using `=PROPER()` and Paste Special.
- **Split Category Column**: Used `Text to Columns` with delimiter `|` to split subcategories.
- **Dropped Irrelevant Columns**: Removed unnecessary columns like `img_link`, `user_name`, `review_title`, `about_product`, etc.

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To answer specific business questions, several calculated columns were created:

- **`Discount_Above50%`**:  
  `=IF(F2>=0.5, 1, 0)` ‚Üí Flags products with ‚â•50% discount.

- **`Potential_Revenue`**:  
  `=Actual_Price √ó Rating_Count` ‚Üí Used to estimate potential earnings.

- **`Price_Range`**:  
  Bucketed prices using:  
  `=IF(E2<200, "<‚Çπ200", IF(E2<500, "‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500", IF(E2<1000, "‚Çπ501‚Äì‚Çπ1000", ">‚Çπ1000")))`

- **`Product<1000_Review`**:  
  `=IF(H2<1000, 1, 0)` ‚Üí Filters products with fewer than 1,000 reviews.

- **`Rating_Score`**:  
  `=G2 * H2` ‚Üí Used to identify top products based on both rating and review volume.
